## Overview

A Chrome extension that celebrates your problem-solving successes with custom media. When you solve a coding problem, the extension detects your success and displays a celebration overlay with your chosen media.

## Features

- Automatic detection of problem completion
- Custom media upload (images, videos, GIFs)
- Celebration overlay with smooth animations
- Configurable trigger conditions
- Works with multiple coding platforms

## Technical Details

Built with vanilla JavaScript for performance, this extension uses Chrome's extension APIs to monitor page changes and detect success states. The celebration overlay is rendered using CSS animations and can display various media formats.

## Challenges & Solutions

One of the main challenges was detecting problem completion across different coding platforms, each with unique DOM structures. This was solved by implementing a flexible pattern matching system that can be configured for different sites.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for more coding platforms
- Implement achievement tracking
- Add social sharing features
- Create a media library for quick access
