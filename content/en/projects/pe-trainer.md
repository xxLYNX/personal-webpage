## Overview

Note - split this project into the malware ml project and a blog post talking about pe-files and the history and format.

Not a day goes by without hearing about some new malware strain targeting Microsoft's Windows OS. And for good reason, while many technical folks may use Linux or MacOS the vast majority of people still use Windows 10 or 11. But windows malware isn't prevalent simply due to the market share.

Love it or hate it the Windows OS is a behemoth of truly impressive size. But just like Rome Windows wasn't built in a day. In fact the modern Windows experience can trace its origins back to at least 1981 when Microsoft purchased 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products. And in a sense much of that MS-DOS era foundation is still alive and well.
