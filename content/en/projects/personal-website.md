## Overview

Developing  a fully custom portfolio website as a self-initiated learning project to better master modern web technologies, including Hugo, Go templates, and Tailwind CSS. Created a reusable theme architecture maintained as a separate open-source project. All as an excuse to later publish some of the more interesting projects I've done previously and, hopefully, provide a valuable source of cybersecurity-focused educational material.
