A collection of projects I've worked on, ranging from malware analysis to machine learning. Please note that this site is a recent project in of itself as I've never built a site before! As many of these projects predate the site migrating them is an ongoing process. As these legacy projects were never intended to be published means they often require refactoring or supplemental materials resulting in a slow transition. In the interest of showcasing my skills legacy projects are uploaded "as is" with the intent to apply a fresh coat of paint to these later this year. Enjoy!
