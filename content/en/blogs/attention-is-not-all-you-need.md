## Introduction

Jet-Nemotron represents a paradigm shift in how we think about attention mechanisms in AI models. Instead of applying attention everywhere, it uses it strategically.

## The Problem with Full Attention

Traditional transformer models apply attention mechanisms across all tokens at every layer. While this is powerful, it's also computationally expensive and often unnecessary.

## Jet-Nemotron's Approach

By selectively applying attention only when needed, Jet-Nemotron achieves:

- **Faster inference times** - Up to 3x speedup on standard benchmarks
- **Better accuracy** - Focused attention leads to more precise results
- **Lower compute costs** - Reduced computational requirements

## Technical Details

The model uses a gating mechanism to determine when full attention is necessary versus when simpler operations suffice.

## Conclusion

This work demonstrates that attention is not all you need—it's about using it intelligently.
