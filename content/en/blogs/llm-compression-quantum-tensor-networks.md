## Introduction

Large Language Models have grown exponentially in size, but are they needlessly huge? CompactifAI explores radical compression techniques.

## The Size Problem

Modern LLMs contain billions or even trillions of parameters, making them expensive to train, deploy, and run.

## Quantum-Inspired Tensor Networks

CompactifAI leverages quantum computing concepts to represent model weights more efficiently:

- **Tensor decomposition** - Breaking down weight matrices into smaller components
- **Entanglement patterns** - Capturing relationships with fewer parameters
- **Compression ratios** - Achieving 10-100x compression with minimal accuracy loss

## Results

The approach demonstrates that much of the parameter space in LLMs is redundant and can be compressed without sacrificing performance.

## Conclusion

This research suggests we can have powerful LLMs without the massive computational footprint.
